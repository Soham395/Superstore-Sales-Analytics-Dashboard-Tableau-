# Superstore-Sales-Analytics-Dashboard-Tableau-
An interactive, single‑page Tableau dashboard to help a retail manager answer three simple questions fast: Where are we selling, what’s profitable, and what should we fix? The report brings together sales, profit, and returns for the Superstore (USA) dataset and lets you drill from category to sub‑category, state, segment, and time in a few clicks.
